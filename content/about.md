I am a life science researcher interested in understanding how mechanical cues regulate
cell-state transitions during cutaneous wound healing.

My research focuses on epithelial mechanotransduction, cytoskeletal dynamics,
and epigenetic regulation, particularly actin-dependent control of DNMT3A
during tissue repair and regeneration.
